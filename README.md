# Weather App

This application displays the user's weather relative to their geolocation. This application displays the location, weather pattern, temperature, and an animated weather icon. The application uses three 3rd party sources to implement full functionality of the app.

* https://openweathermap.org/api for accessing the weather (with latitude and longitude coords)
* https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ for proxying the connection to open weather map
* https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/ for displaying animated weather icons

This project was inspired by "Dev Ed" on Youtube.
